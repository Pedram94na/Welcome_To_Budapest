                <p>Budapest is the capital city of Hungary, located in the heart of Europe. It is often referred to as the "Paris of the East" due to its stunning architecture, rich history, and vibrant cultural scene. The city is divided by the Danube River, with Buda on one side and Pest on the other, each with their unique attractions and charm.</p><br>
                
                <h2>Tourism</h2>
                <p>Budapest is famous for its thermal baths, which are a popular destination for tourists seeking relaxation and rejuvenation. Visitors can also explore the city's numerous museums, galleries, and historic landmarks, such as the magnificent <a href="https://www.parlament.hu/web/visitors" class="extern">Hungarian Parliament Building</a>, the <a href="https://fishermansbastion.com/" class="extern">Fisherman's Bastion</a>, and the <a href="https://budacastlebudapest.com/" class="extern">Castle Hill</a>.With its blend of old-world charm and modern energy, Budapest is a truly unique and exciting destination for travelers from around the world.</p>

                <h3>Danube</h3>
                <p>Originating in Germany, the Danube flows southeast for 2,850 km (1,770 mi), passing through or bordering Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova, and Ukraine. Among the many cities on the river are four national capitals: Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade and Bratislava. Its drainage basin amounts to 817 000 km² and extends into nine more countries.</p>

                <h4>Nightlife</h4>
                <p>Budapest does a lot of things really well. Its restaurants are tasty. Its transport is efficient. Its attractions are cheap. Its architecture is second to none. But if we had to choose, we just might go as far as to say it does one thing better than anything else.</p>

                <h5>History</h5>
                <p>The origins of Budapest can be traced to Celts who occupied the plains of Hungary in the 4th century BC. The area was later conquered by the Roman Empire, which established the fortress and town of Aquincum on the site of today's Budapest around AD 100.</p>
